Algorithm:-

Initialize a variable n to 1. This variable will be used to keep track of the current number in the sequence.

Initialize a variable result to "1". This variable will be used to store the final sequence.

Use a loop to iterate n from 1 to the desired number of terms in the sequence.

In each iteration of the loop:
a. Convert the current value of n to a string and store it in a variable str_n.
b. Initialize a variable count to 1.
c. Initialize a variable temp to an empty string.
d. Use another loop to iterate through the characters of str_n.
e. In each iteration of the inner loop:
i. Compare the current character to the next character.
ii. If the characters are the same, increment the count variable by 1.
iii. If the characters are different, or if you have reached the last character, append the value of count and the current character to temp.
iv. reset count=1
f. Set result to the value of temp.
g. Increment n by 1.

Return the final value of result.
